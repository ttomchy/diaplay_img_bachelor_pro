# what is STL

The Standard Template Library, or STL, is a C++ library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators;[引用](https://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/stl_introduction.html)　There are many data structure and some basic algorithms in the Standard Template Library. The Standard Template Library is a generic library . It is powerfull ,usefull and very efficient to use.Another thing is that the parameters in the STL  are heavily parameterized.This means that every component in the STL is a template.We must understand how template work before we use the STL; like many class libraries, the STL　include many classes such as vector,set,list ,queue,map, hash set,hash map,multiset and so on. Each of the classes is a template and both of them can be instantiated to contain any type of object. There are mainly three parts in the STL container and algorithms as well as iterators.container are used to manage collections of objects of a certain kind. There are several different types of container like dequeue,list,vector,map etc.The algorithms acts on containers.They provides the means that we can perform initialization,sorting,searching and transforming of the contents of containers.The iterators are used to step through the element of collections of objects. These collections may be container or subset of  containers.All the three components have a rich set of pre-defined functions which helps us in doing complicated tasks,in every function.

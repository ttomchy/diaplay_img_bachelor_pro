# What do we do on STL
The Standard template library is very powerfull ,usefull  and efficient. In our algorithm we mainly use the vector,queue as well as std::thread;Vectors aer sequences containers representing arrays.Vectors use contiguous storage locations foe their elements.The array may need to be reallocated in order to grow in size when new elements are inserted,which implies that allocating  a new array and moving all elements into it .It is a relative heavily task in terms of processing time,and thus ,vectors do not reallocate each time an element is add to  the containers.So using vector can help us improve our programming efficiency. Therefore,compared to arrays,vectors consume more memory in exchange for the ability to manage storage and grow dynamically in an efficient way.
Queues are a type of container adaptor ,which is specially designed to operate in a FIFO context (first-in first-out), where elements are inserted into one end of the container and extract from the other.Queues are implemented as containers adaptor.   Queues provide specific set of member functions to access its elements.Elements are pushed into the back of the specific container and popped from its "front".As the queues have so many advantages.We are trying to use queues in our datastructure.As for the thread, thread class is to represent individual threads of execution.A thread of execution is a sequences of instructions that can be executed concurrently with other such sequences in mutithreading environments ,while sharing the same address space.latter we will talk  more about the threads.

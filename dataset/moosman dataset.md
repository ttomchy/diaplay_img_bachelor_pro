# mossman dataset
The challenaging dataset recorded with the Velodyne HDL64E-S2 scanner in the city of Karlsruhe, Germany. Each 360Â° revolution of the Velodyne scanner was stored as 16bit png distance image.The scanner turned clockwise, filling the image from the leftmost to the rightmost column, with the leftmost and rightmost column being at the back of the vehicle.Note that measurements were not corrected for vehicle movement. Thus and due to the physical setup of the laser diods, some strange effects can be seen at the cut of the image when the vehicle is turning. As consequence,it is best to ignore the 10 leftmost and rightmost columns of the image.To convert the pixel values [0..65535] into meters, just divide by 500.This results in an effective range of [0..131m].Invalid measurements are indicated by zero distance.Unfortunately, some frames are completely missing and some frames have only partial data.Missing frames can easily be detected by using the timestamps of the IMU recordings.Missing data within a frame can be detected by looking for invalid distance readings.

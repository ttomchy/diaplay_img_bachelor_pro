###What　is concurrency?
At the simplest and most basic level,concurrency is about two or more separate activities happing at the same [time](引用).In our life we encounter concurrency every day.For instance,we can walk and talk at the same time.or perform different actions while walk and listening to music. Of course, in generally we each go about lives independently of each other.You can reading books while i am playing computer games,and so on. When we talking about the concurrency in terms of the computer.The computer performing multiple independent activities in parallel,rather than sequentially,or one after the other.This phenomenon doesn't a new phenomenon. Multitasking operation system allows a single computer to run multiple applications at the same time through task switching have been commonplace for many years.Historically,most computers only have one processor.This remains true today .These computers only perform one task at one time.however it can switch between tasks many times per second .   By doing a bit of one task and then a bit of another task.So it seems like that are happening concurrently.   This is called task switching.Because the task switching so fast ,we can not tell which point a task may be suspend as the processor switch to another one .Nowadays,computers have many processors which are used for servers and high-performance computing tasks for many years.Nowadays,computers with more than one core have been becoming more and more common.Whether they have multiple processors or multiple cores within a processor.These computers are capable of genuinely running more than one task in parallel.

[figure1.1](这里是在书中的例子的图。)shows an idealized scenario of a computer with precisely two tasks to do.each is divided into 10 parts,the parts have the same size.On a machine which has two processing cores,each task can be executed on its own core.On a single-core machine,the computer must be doing task switching,the parts from each task are interleaved.But they are also spaced out a bit . In order to perform a tasking switching ,We must protected the CPU's state of the current task.when the task is reloaded ,the state must be reloaded.
The parallel computing makes the computer executed different tasks more efficient.
In order to run the program on the robot ,because the hardware resources of the robot are limited,so we cannot process all the programs on only one thread ,the robot cannot process the data only in one thread,so we cannot using only one thread to process all the data.So we must run our program on different threads.we choose to std::threads to process the data from the sensor.A thread of execution is a sequence of instructions that can be executed concurrently with other such sequences in multithreading environments .Different threads  share a same address space.

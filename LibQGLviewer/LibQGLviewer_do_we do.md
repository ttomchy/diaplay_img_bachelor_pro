# What do we do on LibQGLviewer
As we described above,LibQGLviewer is an open source software. It can also show 3D objects on the screen.We use it to draw the 3D points which we get from the dataset.Also,we use it to show the result of our algorithm .LibQGLviewer is used to display the actual operation of different algorithms. The result will be show in the experiment chapter.By using the  LibQGLviewer. We can clearly see the actual performance of different algorithms .It is very efficient and convenient for us to analysis the  performance of different algorithms. We use the algorithms provided in the LibQGLviewer to draw boxes in the screen. Each boxes show different obstacles upon the ground.

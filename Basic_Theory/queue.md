# Overview of queue

Queue is a dynamic set in which the element removed from the set by the DELETE [operation]().The DELETE operation is prespecified.The element deleted  in the queue is the longest element which has been set in the queue. The operation of the queue is a.first-in,first-out,or FIFO.There are several ways to implement queues.We can use queues to do many things.The INSERT  operation was called the ENQUEUE and also we call the DELETE operation the DEQUEUE.DEQUEUE takes no element argument.The FIFO property makes the operation of a queue just like a line of customers waiting to pay a casher.The queue has a head as well as a tail.when an element is enqueued ,the new element  will occupy one place .The place is just at the tail of the line just as the newly arriving customer take a place at the end of the line.The element dequeued is the one which is at the head of the queue.The dequeue operation is the same as the customer at the head of the line who has waited for the longest time.The enqueue and the dequeue operation help us to implement the operation of the queue.when we use the queue ,we must create a queue and when we insert an element, the first operation must be determine  the size of the queue .If the queue is full ,the new element can't be enqueued. Only if the queue doesn't full .then we can enqueued . The dequeue operation is the same as the the enqueue operation .When we delete an element ,the first operation must be determine if there any element in the queue. If the queue is empty,we can't delete an element ,because there is no element in the queue.

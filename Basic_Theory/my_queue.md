# what do we do on queue
The property of the queue is first-in and first-out(FIFO).In our algorithm ,we create a queue to collect the data.We are using muti-threaded programming.There are some variables are shared with different threads.For instance ,a thread is responsible for generate data,another is responsible for consuming data.The speed at which data is generated and consumed is different.So we need a data structure to store the, data the queue must be the best choice.When an new element is enqueued. the position of the new enqueued element must be at the tail of the queue.When another thread is going consume one element ,the element must the the one which waiting for the longest time .We can get the data from the top of the queue. When another thread consume one element, we must delete the element we consumed .

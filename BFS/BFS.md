# Overview of BFS
Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data [structures]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search).It starts at the root and explores the neighbor nodes first,before moving to the next level neighbors.
It was invented in the late 1950s.The author use it to find the shortest path out of a maze. In the following we will discuss the pseudocode of the BFS algorithm.

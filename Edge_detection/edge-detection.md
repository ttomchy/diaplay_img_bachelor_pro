# Edge detection

Edge detection is a fundamental problem in image processing and computer vision. The purpose of edge detection is to identify the point where the brightness of the digital image changes significantly.Image edge detection significantly reduces the amount of data and preserves important structural properties of the image.If the edge is considered to be a certain number of points where the brightness changes, then the edge detection is generally the calculation of the brightness of the derivative.Edge detection with directional information.In edge detection, it is sometimes not desirable to detect all edges.Sometimes we only want to detect a certain type of edge, which requires filtering the edge.For example, we only want to find the edge of the original image in the horizontal direction or the vertical direction of the edge, which requires the use of directional edge detection.If the image of the pixel gray as a height, we can imagine the image into a rugged hilly, where the gray value of the higher places in the gray value of the lower places in the low, then The edge in the image  can be seen as a steep slope in the hills, and the direction of the edge is the direction of the slope.Edge detection with direction also requires a difference in the gray scale of the pixels in the neighborhood. Unlike conventional edge detection, edge detection in the direction of the pixel is not only considered in the neighborhood of the pixel, but also the direction of the transition.


According to the different images there are a variety of filtering methods.Bilateral filtering is a non-linear filtering method that combines the spatial proximity of images and the similarity of pixel values.It not only considers the spatial information and gray similarity, so as to protect the image edge information while achieving the effect of noise reduction. It has a simple, non-iterative, and local features.In the non-edge region, the pixel values of the neighborhood are not very different from each other, and the bilateral filter is equivalent to a Gaussian filter, which can smooth out the pixel value due to noise. And the face of pixel values change the edge of the intense information, the edge of the information will be well retained.Of course, there are many other filtering methods, such as median filtering, Gaussian filtering, mean filtering, these filtering methods for a certain type of noise has their advantage at the same time there are some shortcomings. For different types of noise, we can use different filtering methods, when we do not know which type of filtering method is better, we need to use different methods to do the experiment, used to verify the effect of different methods.In our algorithm to remove the ground to try the Gaussian filtering, mean filtering, median filtering and mean filtering, the final effect, the effect of bilateral filtering is better.

# 3D laser sensor Velodyne
Velodyne is the name of a trio of Silicon Valley-based technology companies focused on audio equipment [link](Velodyne Acoustics)
Velodyne's new  sensor (VLP-16) is the smallest, newest, and most advanced product in Velodyne's 3D LiDAR product range. Vastly more cost-effective than similarly priced sensors, and developed with mass production in mind, it retains the key features of Velodyne's breakthroughs in LiDAR: Real-time, 360Â°, 3D distance and calibrated reflectivity measurements. In the 2005 with the DARPA Grand Challenge which is sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA),Velodyne started their laser distance measurement.The DARPA is a race for vehicles across the desert and it's goal is to  stimulate autonomous vehicle technology development for both commercial and military applications.The VLP-16 have a range of 100 m,andhte sensor is lower power consumption.The power may be 8 w.The velodyne have different return modes ,this makes it ideal not only for autonomous vehicles but also robotics and terrestrial 3D mapping applications.The VLP-16 support 16 channels,about 300000 points per second, 360 degree horizontal files of view and a 30 degree vertical field of view with 15 degree up and down. THE Velodyne  does not have visible rotating parts ,making it highly resilient in challenging environments .The velodyne laser sensor has a wide temperature .
